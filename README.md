HAT I LEARNED FROM THIS TUTORIALS:


Naming Convention: BEM
    double dash: variation of the component
    double underscore: children of the component

React Router: make multiple pages in one-page app

<Link> is for single-page transition while <a> will pull a refresh

useStateValue() pull the state from context api
    pass a list of 2 parameters, object data and action type

useState(): return a value & a value modifier action
    basically like creating a new variable but keep track of it instead of reinitializing

useHistory()



FIREBASE
    firebase firestone db
    firebase hosting
    firebase functions
    firebase emulators:start

moment handles timestamp format
